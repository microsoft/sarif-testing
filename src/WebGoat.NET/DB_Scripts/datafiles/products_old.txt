On the Confederate side was Virginia, a wooden frigate previously known as USS Merrimack, which had been sunk and then rebuilt as an ironclad ram. During the second day of the battle, she encountered the Union Monitor. A completely new design of ironclad, her extremely low profile meant that she had no more than 18 inches of armoured deck visible above the water line. After fighting for several hours, mostly at close range, neither ship had landed a decisive blow, their armour-plating proving effective. Nevertheless, the battle marked the dawn of a new era in maritime warfare.  |4972|101.86|112.05

As a young man he studied the piano, but a hand injury ended his hopes of becoming a virtuoso. Instead, Schumann dedicated himself to composition. During different phases of his career, he focussed on keyboard music, song, chamber music, choral music, opera and symphony.

As Liszt grew older he became increasingly plagued by feelings of desolation and despair; “I carry a deep sadness of the heart which must now break out into sound”. |4505|101.86|112.05

Chopin’s mazurkas, polonaises, preludes, études, nocturnes, ballades, impromptus and many other works have been described as the richest and most influential legacy left to the piano repertoire by any individual composer.
